# Bank Software System Console Application

## Overview
This is a **console-based Java application** that simulates a bank system where users can create and manage different types of accounts. The app allows users to perform various banking tasks, such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds. Additionally, the application features a **pass time** functionality, which simulates the passage of time for account interest calculations, and includes **string input validation** to ensure reliable user input.

The system was developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to ensure that the functionality is robust and well-tested.
